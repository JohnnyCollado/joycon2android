Android gaming and emulation enthusiasts who want to use Nintendo Switch 2 **Joy-Con 2**
controllers as system-wide gamepads on their phone or tablet. They are comfortable with
Developer Options, wireless-debugging pairing, and per-emulator config — this is not a mainstream consumer
audience. Their context is hands-on: often mid-setup at a desk or on a couch, frequently
*holding a controller in one hand* while operating the app with the other, wanting to get
connected and into a game (or emulator) with as little friction as possible and then have
the app stay out of the way.

The primary jobs, screen by screen:
- **Connect** — pair one or more Joy-Con 2 over BLE and confirm they're live.
- **Assign** — map controllers to player slots (P1–P4), single or dual (L+R) layouts.
- **Enable output** — turn on the virtual gamepad and/or DSU motion server.
- **Configure an emulator** — one-tap write of controller/motion bindings (Eden, Dolphin).
- **Verify** — glance at live button/stick/IMU/battery state to confirm everything works.

## Product Purpose

Joy-Con 2 controllers speak BLE over a custom GATT service rather than standard
HID-over-GATT, so Android cannot pair them through normal Bluetooth settings. Joycon2Android
bridges that gap: it connects over GATT, sends the vendor init sequence, parses raw
notification packets, and exposes each assigned player as its own standard virtual HID
gamepad via UHID (through an in-app ADB connection to the device's own wireless-debugging
daemon). It also runs a DSU motion server so
emulators get gyro/accel, and can write emulator controller configs directly.

Success is: a controller goes from SYNC-button to "working in my game/emulator" in well
under a minute, multiplayer "just works" (one distinct device per player), and the app is
trustworthy enough to leave running in the background without a second thought.

## Brand Personality

**Playful gaming gear** — energetic, characterful, unmistakably *about controllers and play*,
not a generic system utility. Three words: **playful, precise, native-to-gaming**.

The personality is carried by substance, not decoration: the standout identity move is that
each controller's card border is drawn from the controller's **real shell color** read out of
SPI flash (saturation-boosted so it reads on the dark UI). The design should lean into that —
color, motion, and layout that celebrate the hardware — while staying tasteful and technically
credible. Playful with restraint, never toy-like.

Voice: confident and direct, speaks the user's language (BLE, DSU, UHID, emulator names) without
over-explaining. Copy is generic and self-explanatory — toggles describe their use case rather
than giving app-specific step-by-step instructions.

## Anti-references

- **Generic Material template.** Stock Material 3, default purple, no identity — reads as a
  scaffold or class project. The controller-color theming exists precisely to avoid this.
- **Consumer-app cutesy.** No blobby mascots, confetti, oversized illustrations, or gamified
  reward theatre. This is enthusiast gear, not a toy.
- **Enterprise dashboard.** Not cold, gray, corporate settings-screen density with no character.
- **Cluttered / overwhelming.** Not a wall of toggles and raw readouts with no hierarchy. Live
  data (IMU, battery, raw state) is available but must be organised, glanceable, and calm.

## Design Principles

1. **The hardware is the hero.** Real controller shell colors, faithful button/stick/IMU
   visualisation, and Switch combo/LED conventions are the identity. Design decisions should
   amplify the physical controller, not abstract it away.
2. **Fast to working, then invisible.** Optimise the SYNC → assigned → in-game path; once set
   up, the app should recede into a reliable background service.
3. **Playful, but never toy.** Energy and character come from color, motion, and the hardware
   theme — held to a tasteful, technically-credible bar.
4. **Show state, don't bury it.** Enthusiasts want to see battery, connection, and live input.
   Surface it with clear hierarchy so richness never becomes clutter.
5. **Speak the user's language.** Assume competence. Use correct domain terms (DSU, UHID,
   wireless debugging, emulator names); keep copy generic and self-explanatory rather than hand-holding.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- **Contrast (WCAG AA).** Body text ≥4.5:1, large/bold text ≥3:1 against its background — a real
  risk on the dark theme with muted-gray text (`TextDim #8B98A5`); verify and bump toward ink
  where borderline.
- **Reduced motion.** Any animation or live-readout motion honours the system reduced-motion
  setting with a calm fallback.
- **Large touch targets.** ≥48dp for primary controls — the app is often operated one-handed
  while the other hand holds a controller.
- **Don't rely on color alone.** Battery and connection state pair color with icon/text so
  status survives color-blindness (currently battery is color-only via `batteryColor()`).
