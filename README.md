# Joycon2Android

Use Nintendo Switch 2 **Joy-Con 2** controllers as system-wide gamepads on Android over BLE.

Joy-Con 2 controllers use BLE with a custom GATT service (not standard HID-over-GATT), so Android can't pair them through normal Bluetooth settings. This app connects over GATT, sends vendor init commands, parses raw notification packets, and creates virtual gamepad devices via UHID so any Android app can use them.

## Features

- Connect multiple Joy-Con 2 controllers simultaneously, plus the Switch 2 Pro Controller (including its GL/GR back paddles)
- Assign controllers to up to 8 players (left, right, or paired); DSU motion and emulator auto-setup cover players 1–4
- **Virtual gamepad output** — each assigned player becomes its own standard HID gamepad, so apps see one controller per player
- **DSU motion server** — gyro/accel + full pad state for emulators (Dolphin, Cemu, …) over UDP, up to 4 independent players, with automatic gyro bias calibration
- **One-tap emulator setup** — writes an emulator's controller config to match the current assignment: Eden (stable or Nightly) or Dolphin GameCube bindings for the virtual gamepad, plus Dolphin's DSU + Wii Remote motion mappings
- **Customizable button mapping** — a per-console editor (GameCube / Joy-Cons / Wii Remote & Nunchuk) overrides the default Joy-Con → emulator bindings the setup writes
- Dual Joy-Con layout when both L+R assigned to one player
- Sideways single Joy-Con layout with rotated inputs (stick, d-pad, face buttons)
- Live display of buttons, sticks, IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope), and battery

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Android device running API 24+ with BLE support
- Android 11+ (API 30) **for the virtual gamepad and emulator auto-setup**, which need wireless
  debugging. BLE connection and the DSU motion server work on API 24+
- Joy-Con 2 controller(s) or a Switch 2 Pro Controller

No companion app and no root: the app pairs with your device's own wireless debugging to get the
shell access it needs for `/dev/uhid`.

### Step 1: Install Joycon2Android

Install the APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/JoeGeC/joycon2android/releases) or build from source. Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted.

### Step 2: Pair with wireless debugging

1. Enable **Developer Options**, then turn on **Wireless debugging**
2. In the app, tap **Pair device** on the Wireless debugging card — it opens the system screen
3. Choose **Pair device with pairing code**
4. Type the six-digit code into the **notification** the app posts

The code goes in the notification rather than the app because the system pairing dialog withdraws
its pairing service the moment another app comes to the foreground. Allow notifications when asked.

Pairing is a one-off: the app keeps its own ADB key, so after a reboot it reconnects on its own
once wireless debugging is back on.

### Step 3: Connect Controllers

1. Put your Joy-Con 2 into pairing mode by pressing the SYNC button
2. Tap "Scan" in the app — the controller should appear within a few seconds
3. Once connected, assign it to a player slot (P1–P8)

### Step 4: Enable Virtual Gamepad

1. With at least one controller assigned, toggle the **Gamepad** switch
2. Each assigned player appears as its **own** input device named `Joy-Con Virtual Gamepad <N>`

Every assigned player becomes a separate standard gamepad — P1, P2, … are distinct devices, so
multiplayer "just works" and emulators can map each to a different port. Any app that supports
gamepads (games, emulators, etc.) sees them. The app runs a foreground service to keep the
connection alive in the background.

**Emulator controller mapping:** with the gamepad on, the Gamepad card shows a picker of the
installed emulators it can configure (currently **Eden** — stable and Nightly — and
**Dolphin (GameCube)**). Pick one and
tap **Set up controller mapping** — it writes that emulator's controller config to match the
current assignment (Eden's `config.ini`, or Dolphin's `GCPadNew.ini` + a Standard Controller on
each GameCube port), then prompts you to restart the emulator. The config icon next to the button
opens a per-console editor to customize which Joy-Con button maps to which emulator button; the
defaults are the layouts described in
[Emulator controller mapping](#emulator-controller-mapping). A single Joy-Con is set up as a Pro
Controller held sideways, so its buttons/stick work in every game (see
[Emulator controller mapping](#emulator-controller-mapping) for why). It needs the privileged path
connected; if the write fails (some OEM builds block writing into another app's `Android/data`),
map the controller manually in the emulator instead.

### Step 5 (optional): DSU Motion Server for emulators

The virtual gamepad can't carry motion (HID gamepads have no motion channel). For gyro
aiming in emulators, enable the DSU ([cemuhook](https://v1993.github.io/cemuhook-protocol/))
server — UDP port 26760, no privileged access needed (so it works on API 24+ too).

1. Assign controllers to players. Player N streams on DSU slot N−1 (P1–P4 only).
   A Joy-Con pair streams motion from its **right** Joy-Con.
2. Toggle **DSU Motion Server** in the app.
3. Point the emulator's DSU/cemuhook input source at the address the app shows
   (`127.0.0.1:26760`) — the server serves emulators running on this phone.
4. Rest each controller on a surface for ~2 s — the server learns the gyro's resting bias
   and re-learns it automatically whenever the controller is still.

DSU and the Virtual Gamepad are independent — enable either or both. With both on, an
emulator sees the controller twice (system gamepad + DSU device); map inputs from one,
and turn the Virtual Gamepad off while mapping so input detection doesn't grab it.

SL, SR and C are not streamed — DSU carries exactly the DS4 button set and every bit is
taken. Exception: a solo sideways Joy-Con's SL/SR arrive as its shoulder buttons.

#### DSU input names (DS4 conventions)

| Joy-Con | DSU name | Joy-Con | DSU name |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `Circle` | B | `Cross` |
| X | `Triangle` | Y | `Square` |
| L / R | `L1` / `R1` | ZL / ZR | `L2` / `R2` |
| − / + | `Share` / `Options` | LS / RS | `L3` / `R3` |
| Home | `PS` | Camera | `Touch` |
| D-Pad | `Pad N/S/E/W` | Sticks | `Left X±/Y±`, `Right X±/Y±` |

#### Dolphin setup

**Automatic:** with DSU on, the DSU card's **Set up Dolphin and Wiimote mapping** button writes
both `DSUClient.ini` (the server entry) and `WiimoteNew.ini` (per-player Wii Remote mappings + the
accelerometer/gyro motion input) to match the current assignment, then prompts you to restart
Dolphin. It needs wireless debugging connected; if the write fails
(some OEM builds block writing into another app's `Android/data`), fall back to the manual steps.

**Manual** (no DSU settings UI — configure by file):

1. Create `Config/DSUClient.ini` inside Dolphin's user folder
   (`Android/data/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu/files/`, containing exactly:

   ```ini
   [Server]
   Enabled = True
   Entries = Joycon2:127.0.0.1:26760;
   ```

2. Restart Dolphin and open Wii Remote N → Emulated. A `DSUClient/<slot>/Joycon2` device
   appears per assigned player. Dolphin starts its DSU client lazily — open an
   input-mapping screen or a game first.
3. **Map every input manually** (long-press a control → Advanced Mapping → pick from the
   input list). Dolphin Android's press-to-detect only sees Android input devices, never
   DSU; motion inputs are not auto-detectable on any platform.
4. Under Motion Input, map all Accelerometer and Gyroscope entries name-to-name, and map
   **Recenter** — gyro pointing drifts, so pressing Recenter in-game while aiming at the
   screen centre is what summons the pointer.
5. Solo horizontal Joy-Con: enable "Sideways Wii Remote".

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Status shows "Not connected" | Turn Wireless debugging on, then tap **Pair device** |
| "Pairing failed" | The code expires quickly — re-open "Pair device with pairing code" and retype it |
| "The pairing window closed" | Don't leave the system pairing dialog; type the code into the notification instead |
| No pairing notification | Allow notifications for the app — the code can only be entered there |
| Stops working after a reboot | Turn Wireless debugging back on; the app reconnects on its own |
| Gamepad card disabled | Wireless debugging needs Android 11+; use the DSU motion server instead |
| Controller not found during scan | Press SYNC again; move closer to device |
| Gamepad not appearing in games | Check `adb shell getevent -p` for "Joy-Con Virtual Gamepad" |
| Controller stops responding | Press SYNC to reset, then reconnect |
| No DSUClient device in the emulator | Check the ini, restart the emulator, open a mapping screen; `adb logcat -s DsuServer` shows whether requests arrive |
| Emulator doesn't detect DSU button presses | Map manually — detection never sees DSU devices; turn the Virtual Gamepad off while mapping |
| Pointer drifts or starts off-screen | Rest the controller ~2 s to recalibrate, then press Recenter |

## Architecture

```
BLE notify ─→ Joycon2Manager ─→ SessionCoordinator ─→ AppUiState ─→ Compose UI
                                       ├──→ UHID relay ─→ /dev/uhid ─→ Android input system
                                       └──→ DSU server ─→ UDP :26760 ─→ emulators (cemuhook)
```

Single-activity Compose app, built as a **Gradle multi-module** project split by **feature ×
layer**. Each feature (`connection`, `assignment`, `gamepad`, `dsu`) has `domain` / `data` /
`presentation` modules, over shared `:core` modules and a thin `:app` composition root. The
split enforces the dependency rules at compile time — a ViewModel can't reach a repository
implementation, because presentation and data are separate modules sharing only domain.

State flows from BLE notifications through `Joycon2Manager` into the `SessionCoordinator`, which
combines connections and player assignments into an immutable `AppUiState` for the UI, and feeds
the same state to the gamepad and DSU outputs on a synchronous per-packet path.

**For contributors:** [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) is the living reference
(module graph, layers, dependency rules, composition root). [`docs/adding-a-feature.md`](docs/adding-a-feature.md)
is the recipe for adding or changing one. The sections below cover the hardware-level detail
those docs link back to.

### Virtual Gamepad (UHID)

The app creates system-wide virtual gamepads using Linux's UHID (User-space HID) interface:

1. **`uhid_relay.c`** — A small native binary that opens `/dev/uhid` and writes UHID events using `write()`. Runs as a shell-uid process (`u:r:shell:s0` SELinux context, which has `/dev/uhid` access).

2. **`UhidRelay.kt`** — Launches the relay binary through a `PrivilegedShell`, sends a UHID_CREATE2 event (4380-byte struct with HID report descriptor), then streams UHID_INPUT2 events through the stdin pipe. `PrivilegedAccess` supplies that shell over an ADB connection to the device's own wireless-debugging daemon, using adbd's raw `exec:` service — not `shell:`, whose PTY would mangle the binary UHID stream. Neither the relay nor the rest of the app cares how the privilege was granted.

3. **`ReportMapper.kt`** — Converts `PlayerState` into a 13-byte HID input report: 14 buttons + hat switch + 2x 16-bit sticks + 2x 8-bit triggers.

4. **`GamepadManager.kt`** — Manages per-player relay instances and collects from `StateFlow<PlayerState>` to drive reports at input rate.

One UHID device is created **per assigned player**, not one shared pad — each is its own
`/dev/uhid` node named `Joy-Con Virtual Gamepad <N>` (N = player number), so Android exposes them
as independent input devices and apps see a separate gamepad per player. Note that the device
*name* carries the player number, but Android assigns each device an `InputDevice` id by
enumeration order, not by player number — so P4 alongside P1 and P2 (no P3) is the 3rd pad,
`Android/3/Joy-Con Virtual Gamepad 4`.
(This is why `DolphinGcpadConfig` keys its `Device = Android/<id>/…` line on enumeration rank while
the section/port stays on the player number.)

The virtual device uses BUS_USB with generic vendor/product IDs (0x1234:0x5678) to ensure the kernel's `hid-generic` driver binds it (Nintendo VID/PID causes the `hid-nintendo` driver to claim and reject the device).

### Emulator controller mapping

The virtual gamepad is a generic HID pad, but each emulator still needs its controller bindings
pointed at it. With the gamepad on, the Gamepad card's emulator picker writes the selected
emulator's config to match the assignment. The generators live in `:feature:gamepad:domain`
(`EdenGamepadConfig`, `DolphinGcpadConfig`) over shared primitives in `:core:emulatorconfig`
(`IniEditor`, `DolphinPaths`); the Joy-Con → emulator-button tables they write are user-editable
per console via `:core:buttonmapping`, with the defaults described below. Three things make this non-obvious — all confirmed against Eden's
source and on-device behaviour:

**1. The Android keycode mapping is shifted.** The HID descriptor declares 14 *generic* buttons, so
Android binds them in the fixed gamepad order `BTN_A, BTN_B, BTN_C, BTN_X, BTN_Y, BTN_Z, BTN_TL…`.
A Joy-Con button therefore lands on a *shifted* keycode, **not** a same-named one:

| Joy-Con | Keycode | Joy-Con | Keycode | Joy-Con | Keycode |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 96 (`BTN_A`) | Y | **99** (`BTN_X`) | − | 104 (`BTN_TL2`) |
| B | 97 (`BTN_B`) | L | **100** (`BTN_Y`) | + | 105 (`BTN_TR2`) |
| X | **98** (`BTN_C`) | R | 101 (`BTN_Z`) | RS | 108 (`BTN_START`) |
| | | ZL | 102 (`BTN_TL`) | LS | 109 (`BTN_SELECT`) |
| | | ZR | 103 (`BTN_TR`) | Home / Camera | 110 / 106 |

D-pad rides the HID hat (Android `AXIS_HAT_X` = 15, `AXIS_HAT_Y` = 16); the sticks are axes
0/1 (left) and 11/14 (right). Eden's config uses these numeric codes; Dolphin's uses the
equivalent control *names* (`Button C` = Switch X, `Button X` = Switch Y, …).

**2. Eden does not translate a sideways single Joy-Con.** For a `JoyconLeft` / `JoyconRight` npad,
Eden masks the raw button bits straight into shared memory and only sets an `is_horizontal` flag —
it never rotates the D-pad into A/B/X/Y. On real hardware that rotation is done by the game's own
statically-linked `nn::hid` library; Eden has no equivalent, so a sideways Joy-Con's directions
reach the game as a plain D-pad. Eden also **masks an npad by type**: a `JoyconLeft` exposes only
D-pad / L / ZL / − / StickL / SL / SR (it has *no* A/B/X/Y), and a `JoyconRight` only
A/B/X/Y / R / ZR / + / StickR / SL / SR (no D-pad, no left stick).

**3. So single Joy-Cons are configured as Pro Controllers,** with the sideways rotation done in our
config rather than left to the emulator: the lone stick → left stick, SL/SR → L/R, and the four
action buttons → A/B/X/Y (the left Joy-Con's D-pad rotated 90° CCW, the right Joy-Con's diamond
90° CW). This costs the authentic single-Joy-Con icon but makes every input work in every game.
Dolphin emulates GameCube (no sideways concept), so `DolphinGcpadConfig` applies the same
pre-rotation, keyed on whatever the relay emits per layout.

**Port disambiguation.** All pads share one GUID (0x1234:0x5678), so emulators tell them apart only
by `port` — the device's enumeration rank among same-GUID devices (the same rank, not player
number, used for Dolphin's `Android/<id>/…` above). Each regenerate clears that player's prior keys
first, so a layout or port change can't leave a stale binding cross-firing onto another player's
port.

### DSU Motion Server

`DsuServer` is a cemuhook UDP server (port 26760, bound to IPv4 `127.0.0.1`). Pad batches
ride a buffered channel off the BLE state path — StateFlow conflation would drop motion
samples. Collaborators:

- **`DsuPacketEncoder`** — the 100-byte pad packets (and version/port-info responses),
  written into a reused buffer at ~120 Hz.
- **`MotionConverter`** — raw Joy-Con IMU frame → cemuhook's DS4 frame. Axes, signs, and
  scale factors were verified on hardware against Dolphin's Wii pointer; see the class
  docs for the measured frames and `tools/README.md` for the calibration workflow.
- **`GyroCalibrator`** — learns each controller's gyro bias whenever it rests and
  subtracts it, mirroring the Switch's own runtime recalibration.
- **`DsuClientRegistry`** — routes each slot's packets only to that slot's subscribers.
  This matters: DSU clients (Dolphin included) overwrite their pad state with every
  received packet without checking the slot, so server-side routing is what keeps
  multiple players independent.

Debug DSU clients for wire inspection and IMU calibration live in `tools/`.

([Joycon2forMac](https://github.com/seitanmen/Joycon2forMac)'s `Joycon2BLEReceiver.mm`).
Where this disagrees with community READMEs, trust this file.

### Identifiers

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer ID (advertising) | `0x0553` (Nintendo) |
| Input service | `ab7de9be-89fe-49ad-828f-118f09df7fd0` |
| Notify characteristic (input packets) | `ab7de9be-89fe-49ad-828f-118f09df7fd2` |
| Write characteristic (commands) | `649d4ac9-8eb7-4e6c-af44-1ea54fe5f005` |
| CCCD descriptor | `0x2902` |

The write characteristic is **WRITE WITHOUT RESPONSE**. Writing to the wrong characteristic (`...fdf`) produces an enabled subscription but no data.

### Advertising

Joy-Con 2 advertisements carry manufacturer data for ID `0x0553`. Bytes `[5..6]` hold the
little-endian product ID that identifies the controller type. Bytes `[10..15]` hold the
**bonded host's MAC address**: a button press wakes a synced controller into a short-lived
reconnect advertisement carrying that address, while holding SYNC (pairing mode) zeroes the
field. The scanner only accepts controllers with a zeroed host field — otherwise every stray
button press on a nearby synced Joy-Con would flash in and out of the device list.

```
pairing:  01 00 03 7E 05 66 20 00 01 00 [00 00 00 00 00 00] 0F ...
wake:     01 00 03 7E 05 66 20 00 01 00 [09 A7 9A 55 E2 98] 0F ...   <- host MAC
```

**Reconnect-on-button-press is console-exclusive** (investigated 2026-06): during a wake
advertisement the Joy-Con refuses GATT connections from anyone but its bonded host
(immediate status 133). Standard SMP bonding is rejected (the controller drops the
connection, status 22). The console pairs at the application layer instead — report
`0x15` cmd `0x01` "PairingSetAddress" exists, but a lone SetAddress write doesn't change
the stored host (the reply just echoes the controller's own MAC), and the rest of the
handshake (cmds `0x02`–`0x04`, presumably the LTK exchange backing the `ConsoleMacA/B` /
`LtkA/B` SPI slots) is undocumented. Even with it documented, reconnect likely requires
link-layer encryption with that LTK, which Android's BLE API cannot inject. Hence: SYNC
is required for every (re)connection.

### Per-Controller Notes

Each controller is an independent BLE peripheral with its own connection and notification stream.
Type detection reads the product ID in the pairing advertisement's manufacturer data (see
[Advertising](#advertising)): `0x2067` = Left Joy-Con 2, `0x2066` = Right Joy-Con 2,
`0x2069` = Switch 2 Pro Controller. The pairing advertisement carries no local name, so this is
the only type signal available before input starts streaming.

Left Joy-Con's right-stick bytes are garbage (ignored); Right Joy-Con's left-stick bytes are garbage.

## HID Report Descriptor

The virtual gamepad uses a standard HID gamepad descriptor (13-byte reports):

| Field | Bits | Range | Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buttons 1-16 | 16 | 0/1 | A, B, X, Y, L, R, ZL, ZR, -, +, LS, RS, Home, Camera, GL, GR |
| Hat switch | 4 | 0-7 or null | D-pad (0=N, 1=NE, 2=E, ..., 7=NW, 0xF=center) |
| Padding | 4 | - | |
| Left Stick X | 16 | -32767..32767 | |
| Left Stick Y | 16 | -32767..32767 | inverted (up = negative) |
| Right Stick X | 16 | -32767..32767 | |
| Right Stick Y | 16 | -32767..32767 | inverted |
| Left Trigger | 8 | 0-255 | digital: 0 or 255 |
| Right Trigger | 8 | 0-255 | digital: 0 or 255 |

## Android BLE Gotchas

1. **MTU first.** Default ATT MTU 23 truncates 63-byte notifications. `requestMtu(247)` after CONNECTED, wait for `onMtuChanged`, then discover services.
2. **One GATT op at a time.** Android serializes writes/descriptor-writes. Queue ops and advance only on the matching callback (`GattOpQueue` handles this).
3. **CCCD required.** `setCharacteristicNotification(true)` alone won't deliver notifications — must also write descriptor `0x2902`.
4. **TRANSPORT_LE.** Pass to `connectGatt` so it doesn't attempt classic Bluetooth.
5. **Connect cooldown.** Repeated quick connect attempts make the Joy-Con stop responding. Press SYNC to re-advertise; wait if unresponsive.
6. **Deprecated API usage.** The `.value =` pattern for writes is used intentionally for API 24+ compatibility. On API 33+ the newer overloads are functionally identical.

---

## Sideways Mode

When a single Joy-Con is assigned to a player, it's held sideways (L rotated 90 CCW, R rotated 90 CW). The UI remaps:

- **Sticks:** L = `(4096 - rawY, rawX)`, R = `(rawY, 4096 - rawX)`
- **D-pad (L):** visual up = Right press, down = Left, left = Up, right = Down
- **Face buttons (R):** Y = top, X = right, A = bottom, B = left
- **SL/SR** become the top rail buttons (like shoulder buttons when held sideways)

This is `SidewaysMapper` in `:core:model` — it rotates the **sticks, the left Joy-Con's D-pad, and
the SL/SR rail**, but passes a right Joy-Con's A/B/X/Y through unrotated (and the left Joy-Con has
no face buttons). The face-button rotation that turns those into a usable sideways layout is applied
per-emulator in the controller-mapping config, not here — see
[Emulator controller mapping](#emulator-controller-mapping).

- **[Joycon2forMac](https://github.com/seitanmen/Joycon2forMac)** by seitanmen — the working macOS
  BLE implementation this project's connection sequence, init commands, and 63-byte packet layout
  were extracted from.
- **[JoyconDriver](https://github.com/german77/JoyconDriver)** by german77 — Nintendo Switch
  controller protocol documentation, including the Switch 2 Wireshark dissector that documents
  report types, command layouts, and the SPI flash map (source of the shell/accent colour
  addresses).
- **[ProCon 2 Enabler Tool](https://handheldlegend.github.io/procon2tool/)** by HandHeldLegend — a
  working Web-Bluetooth implementation whose concrete SPI-read command bytes unlocked reading
  colours from a live controller.
- **[Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering](https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering)**
  by dekuNukem — the original Joy-Con reverse-engineering docs; source of the battery voltage
  thresholds used by the battery gauge.
- **[cemuhook protocol docs](https://v1993.github.io/cemuhook-protocol/)** by v1993 — the DSU wire
  format the motion server implements.
- **[libadb-android](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/libadb-android)** by MuntashirAkon — the
  in-app ADB client (pairing, TLS, and mDNS discovery) that makes the virtual gamepad and emulator
  auto-setup possible without root or a companion app.
